This Artifacts Log post is unusual in how many diverse, quirky models there are across use-cases and modalities. Normally these model roundups are dominated by big models from the likes of Qwen, DeepSeek, Kimi, etc. There are models for all sorts of different use-cases in this post, from optical character recognition (OCR), RAG search, audio transcription, computer-use, code-editing, math theorem proving, and more. The artifacts covered this month also come from a much broader list of open model builders.

This gives us a lot of hope for the future of open models, where we see [the need for domain-specific, cheap models](https://www.interconnects.ai/i/190338833/the-balance-of-power-in-open-vs-closed-models) as being crucial tools to complement the strongest, closed agents. When the top few models get the headlines, this vast, industry-scale tinkering can easily be forgotten. Reading this post gives a technically grounded, broad coverage of the many directions the industry is pushing specific models for. Expect more like this!

To encourage people to take a look at the diversity of models in this issue, the core part of the update is not paywalled. An otherwise quiet month at the top end of open models really delivered.

**Our Picks**

**[NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4)** by [nvidia](https://huggingface.co/nvidia): The long-awaited mid-sized model from NVIDIA is finally here: 120B total params with 12B active, a 1M context window, and support for multiple popular languages. Furthermore, the model is based on LatentMoE and uses NVFP4 during pre-training, which is a first for open models. Like other things from NVIDIA, it comes with an in-depth [tech report](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/nemotron/files/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-Technical-Report.pdf) plus [pre-training](https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemotron-pre-training-datasets) and [post-training](https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemotron-post-training-v3) datasets, with the vast majority of the data being openly released.

**[cohere-transcribe-03-2026](https://huggingface.co/CohereLabs/cohere-transcribe-03-2026)** by [CohereLabs](https://huggingface.co/CohereLabs): A speech-to-text model by Cohere based on the [conformer architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08100), similar to NVIDIA’s Parakeet. It features 14 different languages, including some AIPAC languages and Arabic. Performance-wise, Cohere claims it beats similarly sized open and closed models. To top it all off: The model is released under Apache 2.0! Previous open models by Cohere were released under a non-commercial license.

**[sarvam-105b](https://huggingface.co/sarvamai/sarvam-105b)** by [sarvamai](https://huggingface.co/sarvamai): The Indian startup Sarvam, which trained open models in the past, has scaled up everything for its new flagship models in terms of dataset size (12-16T tokens) and model size ([30B-A2B](https://huggingface.co/sarvamai/sarvam-30b), 105B-10A). As a result, they come close to or even surpass a lot of open models with similar sizes. The release also shows why sovereign AI is so important, something that few other countries have internalized yet: In comparison with SOTA open models, the Sarvam models are vastly more preferred in Indic languages.

While the previous version was based on open data, the new version, based on Seed-Coder-8B, is trained on open source code by users who explicitly opted into data collection.
